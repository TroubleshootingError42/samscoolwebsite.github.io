      <h6>and here's what I did:</h6>
      <h2>3/23/21</h2>
      <h4>So my genius hour project was to just code some HTML into something like a file or into a website that displays the html, but then <b>[technology teahcer]</b> desided to educate us on the topic so I've decided to make my own website which as of now is going ok and not ok. After waiting a month for my mom to get her PayPal figured out I finally got to purchase what is called a domain which is basically a place with a name where you put your website in this case <a id="lazyman" href="things/lazy.html">samscoolwebsite.com</a>. Unfortuanately it's really complicated and I can't just throw the html into the site so I'll try and figure some stuff out tomorrow.</h4>
      
      
      <h2>3/24/21</h2>
      <h4>So from what I've gathered I'm pretty sure a domain is just an actual name for a website. You know how we used google sites to sort of make a blog for our project. Well I'm using google sites to do this except the url isn't just going to be "sites.google.com/view/튌̶̢͈̍̾㳶̴̼̙́͝U̶̪͗̇ぼ̶̷͖͉̪͑̈́֕̈́̈Ҽ̵̮͋�̸̟̀�̵̨̤͘͠ą̸͔̃" it's going to be something more recognizable. And I have been figuring it out I can just throw the html onto the google site but I have to mess around with it a bit to make it look like just html. That's all for now.</h4>
      
      <h2>4/5/21</h2>
      <h4>So I took a "short" break for my birthday and contrary to popular belief my birthday lasts 11 days. For progress the website works but it is blank apart from the website icon which for now is Ronald Reagan</h4>
      
      <h2>4/8/21</h2>
      <h4>So I've changed the format of the website so that this explaination page isn't the home page</h4>

      <fear>
      <i>
      <h2>4/16/21</h2>
      <h4>the seinfeld button has been created. </h4>
      </i>
      </fear>
      
      <h2>4/18/21</h2>
      <h4>My main goal today is to actualy get the website to run the code so if I get there I get there.<br> The answer is no but I'm getting somewhere. It has something to do with syncing up the google domain to github pages so now I have a github account. Things are very complicated.</h4>
      
      <h2>4/19/21</h2>
      <h4>Alright today I shall continue to try to get the html onto the site.<br>Update: My god this is complicated. I've resorted to making a Quora account to ask what to do and if I don't get any clear answers there's something else I'll try</h4>

      <h2>4/20/21<funny>nice</funny></h2>
      <h4>From this point until I'm actually successful I'm gonna focus on the getting it on the internet rather than the html. Except for tonight, tonight I'm gonna work on my minecraft texture pack page.</h4>

      <h2>4/28/21</h2>
      <h4>I haven't been updating much but I've been working and I think I'm finally onto something. I was able to get part of the code onto the internet (but under a much different name than samscoolwebsite) I'm trying to figure out how to give it a custom name but scince I've already got samscoolwebsite.com I'll probably have to get something like samscoolwebsite.io but I'm getting somewhere<br>Update: I did not make any progress and rocket science pales in comparison</h4>

      <h2>4/29/21</h2>
      <h4>I'm pretty sure I've sort've done it. I have made it so that, instead of the site just being the html, it links you to a page on github that has all the html in it but it's under the name "troubleshootingerror42.github.io/samscoolwebsite.github.io/", but you don't have to remeber that, you just need to type in samscoolwebsite.com. Also I didn;t really work on my minecraft texture pack, I just tried to figure this out and didn't feel like logging it because it's boring. Let's just say that I found a lot of dead ends. But even then as I'm typing this I am not 100% sure this will work because it said the change would take place within 48 hours, but I'm fairly certain. But hopefully this can bring a conclusion to this stressful search for what the hecc I actually had to do.</h4>
